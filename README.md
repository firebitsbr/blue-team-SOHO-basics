# Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for SOHO [blue team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_team_(computer_security))a

This repository is a curated collection for cybersecurity defenders in the Small Office / Home Office environment, which means we only include things that...

- are cheap or free of charge (< 100 US$ at max)
- can be setup and verified in less than a workday
- are relatively low on maintenance (so high in automation)
- have a good to excellent cost/benefit ratio
